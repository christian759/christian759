# 👋 Hi, I’m Christian

## Blockchain Engineer

I’m a **Blockchain Engineer** focused on building **decentralized systems, smart contracts, and Web3 applications** with production-grade standards. My work spans **on-chain logic, Web3 infrastructure, and user-facing dApp interfaces**, with a strong emphasis on correctness, security, and scalability.

I build for real users, real protocols, and real constraints.

## 🧠 Technical Expertise

### Blockchain & Web3
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **EVM Ecosystem:** Ethereum, EVM-compatible chains
- **Libraries & Tooling:** ethers.js, viem, Hardhat
- **Concepts:**
  - Contract architecture & interfaces
  - Events, logs, and indexing
  - Transaction lifecycle & gas mechanics
  - Permissions, approvals, and security fundamentals
  - Wallets, RPCs, and providers

### Frontend for Web3
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Web3 UX:** wallet connections, transaction states, error handling

### Backend & Systems (Growing Depth)
- API-driven architectures
- Blockchain data consumption
- Distributed system awareness
- Preparing for protocol and infrastructure-level work

### Tooling & Workflow
- Git & GitHub
- npm / pnpm
- Environment-based configuration
- Clean project structure and documentation
- CI-friendly development practices
