# Hi, I’m Christian 👋  
### Full Stack Developer | Web Developer | Blockchain & Web3 Developer | Smart Contracts | dApps | DeFi & Infrastructure

I am a Blockchain and Web3 developer with a strong focus on designing, building, and testing decentralized systems. My work spans smart contract development, on-chain integrations, and backend infrastructure that supports real-world Web3 applications.

I approach Web3 engineering with a product mindset: understanding protocol design, security considerations, and how decentralized systems behave in production—not just how to write contracts.
